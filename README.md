# MM_Notice

This is a pet project meant to notify myself via text of when the Mega Millions jackpot reaches a certain amount ($300 M) and when it is won.

The reasoning behind playing the lottery in that range is simple. While _my_ odds of winning never change, the odds that _someone_ wins goes up with the increased attention and participation MM receives with a high jackpot. It results in me entertaining myself for a shorter period of time, therefore spending less money. Still more affordable entertainment than Starbucks. After around $300M, the jackpot quickly rises and is soon won.
